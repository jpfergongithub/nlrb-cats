Case files and code for NLRB union representation elections

This repository has copies of publicly available files from the National Labor Relations Board, holding closed-case records from the NLRB's various case-tracking databases. Also contained here are bash scripts for fixing the file encoding of those records and writing CSV-formatted files, and Stata scripts to convert those files into DTA format.
